    <h2>Tree:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Total CO<sub>2</sub> captured (Kg):</strong> Estimated total CO<sub>2</sub> captured by the tree in its entire time of growth, starting October 2022 until the current day, based on the current diameter and height of the tree. The net storage of carbon dioxide by the tree corresponds to the CO<sub>2</sub> consumed through photosynthesis, minus the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by it through respiration. <sup class="footnote citation-popup-trigger" data-id="1">[1]</sup></li>
            <li><strong>Diameter today (cm):</strong> The diameter of the tree at the ground level is measured once a day to estimate the tree's weight and follow its growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Height today (cm):</strong> The total height of the tree is measured once a day to estimate the tree's weight and follow its growth. </li>
            <li><strong>Dry biomass (kg):</strong> The biomass, or the weight of the tree, is estimated from its diameter at ground level and its current total height, along with the observed density of young <i>Paulownia</i> trees <sup class="footnote citation-popup-trigger" data-id="45678910">[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</sup>. This specimen was pruned about a year ago at the tree nursery, subtracting from its weight. The biomass and carbon capture in this calculator correspond to the current, living mass of the plant.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon content (kg):</strong>The carbon content of a young <i>Paulownia tomentosa</i> is approximately 47% of the dry biomass of the plant <sup class="footnote citation-popup-trigger" data-id="6">[6]</sup>. The tree binds carbon and oxygen from CO<sub>2</sub> as it produces glucose molecules through photosynthesis. As the tree produces carbon chains, it grows, gaining weight.</li>
