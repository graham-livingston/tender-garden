        <ul>
            <li><strong>Total CO<sub>2 eq</sub> emitted (Kg):</strong> The estimated CO<sub>2 eq</sub> emitted by the server's electricity usage over its entire time of operation starting 16<sup>th</sup> August 2024, based on the electricity mix in this building. This building is served by an ecological electricity mix (<i>Ökostrom</i>) from water, solar, and wind power <sup class="footnote citation-popup-trigger" data-id="2">[2]</sup>. Even though these renewable sources emit no CO<sub>2</sub> in the direct conversion of natural energy to electricity, they incur CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas emissions in their infrastructure, maintenance, and transport <sup class="footnote citation-popup-trigger" data-id="3">[3]</sup>. The electricity used by the server is only a fraction of the energy and resources mobilized by a website.</li>
            <li><strong>Current CO<sub>2 eq</sub> emissions (Kg):</strong> Real-time CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions corresponding to current electrical usage assessed directly by the meter on the server.<br><br> The CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent mass considers CO<sub>2</sub> as well as other greenhouse gas emissions (N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub>) from the entire chain of production of the electricity.</li>
            <li><strong>Total electricity use (kWh):</strong> Total energy use of the server since activation on 16 August 2024. The current and total CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions are estimated based on the average emissions from the production of electricity for the EWS Ökostrom mix, which is used in this building <sup class="footnote citation-popup-trigger" data-id="3">[3]</sup>.</li>
            <li><strong>Current electrical usage (kWh):</strong> Real-time electricity use of the server measured directly by the meter on the server.</li>
